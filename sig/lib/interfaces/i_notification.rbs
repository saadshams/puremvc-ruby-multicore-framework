module PureMVC
  # The interface definition for a PureMVC Notification.
  #
  # PureMVC does not rely upon underlying event models such
  # as the one provided with Flash, and ActionScript 3 does
  # not have an inherent event model.
  #
  # The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists
  # to support event-driven communication between the
  # application and the actors of the MVC triad.
  #
  # Notifications are not meant to be a replacement for Events
  # in Flex/Flash/AIR. Generally, <code>_IMediator</code> implementors
  # place event listeners on their view components, which they
  # then handle in the usual way. This may lead to the broadcast of <code>Notification</code>s to
  # trigger <code>_ICommand</code>s or to communicate with other <code>_IMediators</code>.
  # <code>_IProxy</code> and <code>_ICommand</code>
  # instances communicate with each other and <code>_IMediator</code>s
  # by broadcasting <code>_INotification</code>s.
  #
  # A key difference between Flash <code>Event</code>s and PureMVC
  # <code>Notification</code>s is that <code>Event</code>s follow the
  # 'Chain of Responsibility' pattern, 'bubbling' up the display hierarchy
  # until some parent component handles the <code>Event</code>, while
  # PureMVC <code>Notification</code>s follow a 'Publish/Subscribe'
  # pattern. PureMVC classes need not be related to each other in a
  # parent/child relationship to communicate with one another
  # using <code>Notification</code>s.
  #

  # @see IObserver

    # @return [String] the name of the notification
    def name: () -> String

    # @return [Object, nil] the body of the notification
    def body: () -> Object?

    # @return [String, nil] the type of the notification
    def type: () -> String?

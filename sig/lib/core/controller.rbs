module PureMVC
  # A Multiton <code>IController</code> implementation.
  #
  # In PureMVC, the <code>Controller</code> class follows the
  # 'Command and Controller' strategy and assumes these responsibilities:
  #
  # * Remembering which <code>ICommand</code>s are intended to handle which <code>INotifications</code>.
  # * Registering itself as an <code>IObserver</code> with the <code>View</code> for each <code>INotification</code>
  #   that has an <code>ICommand</code> mapping.
  # * Creating a new instance of the proper <code>ICommand</code> to handle a given <code>INotification</code> when notified by the <code>View</code>.
  # * Calling the <code>ICommand</code>'s <code>execute</code> method, passing in the <code>INotification</code>.
  #
  # Your application must register <code>ICommands</code> with the <code>Controller</code>.
  #
  # The simplest way is to subclass <code>Facade</code>, and use its <code>initializeController</code> method
  # to add your registrations.

    # directly. Instead, call the static factory method, passing the unique key for this instance:
    # <code>PureMVC::Controller.getInstance(key) { |key| PureMVC::Controller.new(key) }</code>

    # in your application, you should also subclass Controller
    # and override the initialize_controller method in the
    # following way:
    #
    # @example
    #   # ensure that the Controller is talking to my IView implementation
    #   def initialize_controller
    #     @view = MyView::get_instance(key) { |key| MyView.new(key) }

    # an ICommand has been registered for this notification name.

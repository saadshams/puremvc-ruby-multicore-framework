module PureMVC
  #
  # The interface definition for a PureMVC <code>_IMediator</code>.
  #
  # In PureMVC, <code>_IMediator</code> implementors assume these responsibilities:
  #
  # * Implement a common method that returns a list of all <code>_INotification</code>s
  #   the <code>_IMediator</code> has interest in.
  # * Implement a notification callback method.
  # * Implement methods that are called when the <code>_IMediator</code> is registered or removed from the <code>View</code>.
  #
  # Additionally, <code>_IMediator</code>s typically:
  #
  # * Act as an intermediary between one or more view components such as text boxes or list controls,
  #   maintaining references and coordinating their behavior.
  # * In Flash-based apps, this is often the place where event listeners are
  #   added to view components, and their handlers implemented.
  # * Respond to and generate <code>_INotifications</code>, interacting with the rest of the PureMVC app.
  #
  # When an <code>_IMediator</code> is registered with the <code>_IView</code>,
  # the <code>_IView</code> will call the <code>_IMediator</code>'s <code>list_notification_interests</code> method.
  # The <code>_IMediator</code> will return an <code>Array</code> of <code>_INotification</code> names
  # which it wishes to be notified about.
  #
  # The <code>_IView</code> will then create an <code>Observer</code> object
  # encapsulating that <code>IMediator</code>'s <code>handle_notification</code> method
  # and register it as an Observer for each <code>_INotification</code> name returned by <code>list_notification_interests</code>.
  #
  # @see INotification
